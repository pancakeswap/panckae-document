# ðŸ–¥ PancakeSwap Private RPC

Are you worried about your trades being frontrun by MEV bots onchain? Worry no more - use PancakeSwapâ€™s private RPC to protect your trades.

Available on both Ethereum and BNB Chain.

### What the Private RPC does

In partnership with bloXroute, we are allowing users to utilize a private channel for submitting their onchain trades. This means that when you execute a trade on PCS, your transactions are not publicly available in the mempool, and therefore bots/MEV searchers will not be able to see your trade before it has been confirmed on the blockchain.

This means that there is no opportunity for onchain bots to frontrun your trades.

### Privacy = good, how do I use the RPC?

Below instructions are for Ethereum and BNB Chain only, as we only support private RPCs on these chains.

**1. Open Metamask and click on "Settings"**

**2. Click on "Networks", and then click on "Add Network" on the Networks menu.**\
