### What is Zap <a href="#id-27eed32c-a46a-44f9-98ee-2a3f74e0dadd" id="id-27eed32c-a46a-44f9-98ee-2a3f74e0dadd"></a>

Zap is a feature that allows you to add liquidity with ease. With Zap, you can provide V3 liquidity with only one of the tokens from the liquidity pool. Simply set the price range, choose the amount to provide, and execute. Your tokens will be automatically balanced to form the liquidity position while being traded in the most efficient way, with the lowest price impact and slippage.

If you want to further customise your Zap experience. Simply click the gear icon in top right hand corner. In the settings, you may configure:

* The max slippage while zapping.
* The timeline on the transaction deadline.
* Whether to use KyberSwap’s aggregated liquidity to perform token rebalance. Toggle this off if you only want to trade in PancakeSwap Pools.
* Degen mode can be used to perform super high slippage Zaps. Not recommended for normal use cases, use it at your own risk.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the Slippage and Deadline settings are independent to the Swap and Liquidity page.
