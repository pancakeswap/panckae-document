# Zap

### What is Zap <a href="#id-27eed32c-a46a-44f9-98ee-2a3f74e0dadd" id="id-27eed32c-a46a-44f9-98ee-2a3f74e0dadd"></a>

Zap is a feature that allows you to add liquidity with ease. With Zap, you can provide V3 liquidity with only one of the tokens from the liquidity pool. Simply set the price range, choose the amount to provide, and execute. Your tokens will be automatically balanced to form the liquidity position while being traded in the most efficient way, with the lowest price impact and slippage.

### How to Use <a href="#id-438fff0f-f1da-4147-9fe3-6dc1dc2ef352" id="id-438fff0f-f1da-4147-9fe3-6dc1dc2ef352"></a>

#### Before <a href="#id-0c300e46-c7df-4ed4-b9b2-ecb10b31a1f6" id="id-0c300e46-c7df-4ed4-b9b2-ecb10b31a1f6"></a>

For now, Zap only supports:

* üÜï Any token!
* Using single token
* üÜï Using duo tokens
* üÜï Or... using multiple tokens (yes it's can be used like dust collector)
* And on BNB Chain (more network is coming)

Within the new ‚ÄúZap in‚Äù modal. You may find the following fields:

1. The trading pair you are Zapping (providing liquidity) to.
2. The deposit token(s) and the amount(s) to deposit. You may freely add in or remove any tokens for the Zap.
3. The price range of the new position. You may also click the arrows to flip between different price displays.
4. A detailed breakdown of how the Zap feature will handle your deposit tokens.
5. A summary of the stats including:
   1. Estimated value in USD for the new liquidity position.
   2. Estimate token amount in the new liquidity position.
   3. Estimated leftover funds in USD after Zapping. In most cases it should be 0. If the liquidity pool or the tokens have very little liquidity, this value may increase.
   4. The price impact for the token swaps and rebalances while Zapping.
   5. The price impact for the liquidity adding and position building.
   6. Zap fee. Depending on the liquidity pair, fee rate may vary.

If you want to further customise your Zap experience. Simply click the gear icon in top right hand corner. In the settings, you may configure:

* The max slippage while zapping.
* The timeline on the transaction deadline.
* Whether to use KyberSwap‚Äôs aggregated liquidity to perform token rebalance. Toggle this off if you only want to trade in PancakeSwap Pools.
* Degen mode can be used to perform super high slippage Zaps. Not recommended for normal use cases, use it at your own risk.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that the Slippage and Deadline settings are independent to the Swap and Liquidity page.

#### Zap in using duo tokens

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now you may Zap in your liquidity with duo tokens. This is useful when your available balance is not matching with the price settings, and the required token amount and ratio it is calling for. Simply Zap, and the ratio will be automatically rebalanced.

#### Zap in using many tokens

Yes it works just like a dust token collector. It is suitable for cleaning up small balances in your wallet, and put them into a position to start earning from trading fees.&#x20;
