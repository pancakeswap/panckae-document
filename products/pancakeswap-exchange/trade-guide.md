![](../../.gitbook/assets/how-to-trade-on-pancakeswap-header.png)

Trading on PancakeSwap is very easy compared to most exchanges. You aren't going to be overwhelmed by charts or jargon, and trading routes and calculations are all handled for you by the PancakeSwap Smart Router.

**Getting set up to trade**

Before you can trade, you will need a wallet that is compatible with BNB Chain or Ethereum. You can learn how to get one [here](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/get-started/wallet-guide). You will also need to have some BEP-20 or ERC-20 tokens to trade with. You can learn how to get some [here](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/get-started/bep20-guide).

Alternatively, you can learn how to get an Aptos-compatible wallet [here](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/get-started-aptos/wallet-guide), and how to get some Aptos coins to swap within [here](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/get-started-aptos/aptos-coin-guide).

## Trading on the PancakeSwap exchange

1 - Go to the exchange page [here](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap).



2 - Unlock your wallet by clicking Connect **Wallet** (you can also **Connect** in the top right-hand corner). If you haven't yet connected your wallet to PancakeSwap, you can view the guide [here](https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/get-started/connection-guide).

3 - Choose the token you want to trade from the dropdown menu in the upper section. Whichever token you choose, you will need to make sure you have a sufficient amount of them in your wallet to trade with. Your balance is shown above the token dropdown menu.

4 - Choose the token you want to trade to in the lower section as above.



5 - Next, either type an amount in the upper section to input the number of tokens you want to swap (spending amount). Or, type an amount in the lower section to input the number of tokens you want to swap to (receiving amount).&#x20;

Whichever section you input your amount, the amount in the other section will be estimated automatically.



6 - Check all the details, and click the **Swap** button.

If you are trading a token for the first time, you may need first to click "Enable XXX (your token)" to approve.

## **What is Smart Router V3, and how to use it?**

PancakeSwap Smart Router is a routing algorithm that links V3, V2, StableSwap (BNB Chain), and the AMM and market makers (BNB Chain & Ethereum), to always provide liquidity and pricing. On default, it executes trades across multiple pools to find the best price for traders.

Smart Router is now the default route for PancakeSwap Exchange V3. However, users are free to customize it for their needs.
